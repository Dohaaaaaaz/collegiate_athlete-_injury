ðŸ“ˆ Introduction
In the realm of competitive sports, understanding the factors that influence athlete performance is crucial for optimizing training regimens, enhancing recovery strategies, and reducing injury risks. With increasing data availability, sports science has evolved to leverage analytics to evaluate athlete performance holistically. This project focuses on analyzing a dataset that encompasses various attributes of athletes, including physical characteristics, training intensity, recovery patterns, performance scores, and injury indicators. By conducting a thorough analysis of these factors, we aim to derive actionable insights that can inform training strategies and improve athletic outcomes.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
This dataset contains information about Crime Prediction , including:

Age: The age of the athlete, which can impact performance and recovery.

Gender: The gender of the athlete, providing insights into demographic differences.

Height_cm: The height of the athlete in centimeters, a factor that may influence position and performance.

Weight_kg: The weight of the athlete in kilograms, another physical characteristic related to performance.

Position: The playing position of the athlete (e.g., Center, Forward, Guard), which may correlate with performance metrics.

Training_Intensity: A score representing the intensity of the athlete's training, reflecting the level of effort and stress during workouts.

Training_Hours_Per_Week: The number of hours dedicated to training each week, a critical factor in performance outcomes.

Recovery_Days_Per_Week: The number of days allocated for recovery each week, essential for optimal performance and injury prevention.

Match_Count_Per_Week: The number of matches played per week, indicating competition exposure.

Rest_Between_Events_Days: The rest days between competitive events, impacting fatigue and recovery.

Fatigue_Score: A subjective score reflecting the athlete's fatigue level, which can influence performance.

Performance_Score: An objective score quantifying the athlete's performance level in their sport.

Team_Contribution_Score: A score reflecting the athlete's contribution to the team's overall performance.

Load_Balance_Score: A measure indicating how well the athlete manages training load and recovery.

ACL_Risk_Score: A score assessing the risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, crucial for injury prevention.

Injury_Indicator: A binary variable indicating whether the athlete has experienced an injury.
